"""Asset audit: every rbxassetid consumed in configs/src must be traceable.

An id is TRACEABLE when it appears in a scripts/*.json manifest (meaning it was
uploaded by a pipeline script and its source lives in assets/) or in the known-
legacy allowlist (scripts/migration/asset_orphans_allowlist.json — Studio-era
uploads being remapped by the group migration).

    python3 scripts/audit_assets.py            # report
    python3 scripts/audit_assets.py --strict   # exit 1 on NEW orphans (CI)

Why: untracked Studio-side uploads are how the game accumulated 100+ asset ids
with no local source and no record of what they were — discovered the hard way
during the group-ownership migration (2026-06-11).
