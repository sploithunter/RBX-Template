# Heaven & Hell Pet Design Prompts (layers 2–4)

Status: design — Jason, 2026-06. Meshy text-to-3D generation prompts for every roster pet in
layers 2, 3, and 4 (60 pets). Companion to [PET_REALM_HEAVEN_HELL_ROSTER.md](PET_REALM_HEAVEN_HELL_ROSTER.md)
(roles/rarity/odds) and the [Design Document](PET_REALM_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md) (palette + dragon rules).

Pipeline: generate in Meshy → group upload → mesh combine (see the pet mesh/texture pipeline).
Remember the gotcha: the combine's `texture_asset` needs the **IMAGE** id, not the Decal id.

## How to use these

Each pet below is a **subject clause**. Build the final prompt as:

> `STYLE` + `<pet subject clause>` + (optional `GOLDEN` suffix)

### STYLE — prepend to every prompt
> Stylized cute Roblox-style collectible game pet, single creature, full body, centered, facing
> forward in a neutral idle pose, chunky rounded friendly proportions, clean smooth forms suited
> to low-poly game use, soft even shading, no base or platform, plain neutral background.

(Dragons & apexes: add "large, majestic, heroic, extra detail" — and note dragons need a higher
viewport zoom on import, per the existing dragon entries in `configs/pets.lua`.)

### Variant suffix — covers the gold version of EVERY pet
Golden is a **recolor of the same sculpt** — never change the silhouette. So a pet's golden
prompt is literally its base prompt + the GOLDEN suffix. This is why there is no separate
per-pet gold list: append it to any base below.

> **GOLDEN VARIANT** — identical sculpt and silhouette; re-skin the entire surface as lustrous
> polished gold with a bright metallic sheen and warm highlights; eyes become faceted gemstones;
> subtle golden sparkle. Recolor only, form unchanged.

> **Rainbow is NOT generated** — it's a runtime **effect** (shader / VFX overlay) on the base
> model, so it needs no prompt and no separate mesh. Only base + golden get generation prompts.

> Note: gold and rainbow are still the cross-cutting shiny tiers, so the **base** palettes below
> deliberately avoid gold/rainbow as a dominant color — that keeps a shiny reading as a shiny.
