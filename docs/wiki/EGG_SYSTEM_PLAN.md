# Egg System Plan

Status: in progress

Implemented so far:

- `configs/egg_system.lua` now declares `hatching.max_count = 99`, partial-hatch policy, transaction lock timing, compatibility purchase counts, animation policy, and shop/entitlement stubs.
- `EggService` accepts both legacy `eggType, purchaseType` calls and new table requests with `requestedCount`; the server resolves actual hatch count from entitlement, currency, auto-delete, and mixed pet storage before charging.
- Per-player hatch locks now cover the server transaction, blocking rapid repeat requests that previously created invisible hatches.
- Batch responses include legacy `Pet`/`Type`/`Power` fields plus `requestedCount`, `hatchCount`, `results`, `stopReason`, `entitlements`, and authored egg animation metadata.
- Client hatch controls now support `E` single hatch, `R` max hatch, and `T` auto hatch through the same server-authoritative endpoint.
- Auto hatch now uses a config-driven loop delay, server-validated auto hatch entitlement, and session ids so stale stopped sessions do not drive client presentation.
- `EggInteractionService` now owns a config-driven hatch panel with selected-count controls, Hatch/Max/Auto buttons, stop/status messaging, and a compact auto-delete filter drawer for rarity, pet-family, and variant filters backed by the existing server filter event.
- Hatch mode toggles now flow through the same request contract: Golden mode is server-entitlement checked, gives locked-mode feedback, applies the configured cost multiplier, and excludes basic variants; Fast/Silent/Skip are returned as presentation options for hatch animation.
- Charged mode now uses the same config-first hatch mode path: it is server-entitlement checked, has a configured cost multiplier, and applies configured hatch-luck and secret-luck bonuses before the pet/variant roll.
- Admin hatch entitlement controls now expose the current shop stubs for testing: Auto, Golden, Charged, Fast, Skip, and max hatch count can be locked/unlocked/reset from the admin panel without changing code or waiting for the shop UI.
- The hatch settings drawer now has config-driven help copy for auto-delete filters, hatch mode toggles, and core hatch controls. Hover/focus text is stored on the controls as `HelpText` attributes so player education stays data-driven.
- `EggBatchHatchSmoke` covers multi-hatch cost/count behavior, rapid-repeat rejection, partial hatching when funds or storage only cover a smaller count, hatch-time auto-delete inventory/stat behavior, locked Auto/Golden/Charged mode rejection, auto session id echo on errors, Golden mode cost/no-basic behavior, and Charged mode cost behavior.
- `EggAutoHatchSmoke` covers client auto-hatch stop feedback for no currency, no storage, and moving too far away.
- `EggProximitySmoke` also verifies the hatch panel appears near eggs with its expected controls and hatch drawer help text.
- `HatchEntitlementAdminSmoke` covers the admin-managed hatch entitlement path and restores player attributes after testing.
- Authored egg animation ViewportFrames use config-driven scale: a global default in `egg_system.hatching.animation.authored_visual_scale` plus per-egg overrides such as `pets.egg_sources.basic_egg.animation.authored_visual_scale`.
- Hatch reveal polish is now partly config-driven. `egg_system.hatching.animation.reveal_badges` controls rarity, variant, special, and auto-delete badges, while `EggHatchingService:GetActiveAnimationDebugState()` exposes the active animation metadata for Studio smokes. `EggAnimationContractSmoke` verifies special and auto-deleted reveal markers on the client animation layer.
- The hatch settings drawer now exposes mode entitlement state before the server rejects a hatch. Mode controls carry `ModeState`, `ModeOwned`, and dynamic help text attributes, and a `ModeStatus` line summarizes active and locked modes from config/player attributes.
- `EggService` now keeps a bounded, config-sized recent hatch history for each player. The history records successes and rejected hatch requests with requested count, actual hatch count, cost, stop reason, options, entitlements, sampled results, auto-delete counts, special counts, and authored animation metadata. Admin tools can request this snapshot, and `EggHatchHistorySmoke` verifies the server debug contract.
- Studio forced hatch setup is now deterministic. `EggService` reads `ForcePet`/`ForceVariant` player attributes before rolling instead of relying only on mutating a copied config table, so storage/history smokes can force unique or auto-deleted outcomes reliably.
- `ConfigLoader` now validates the egg-system hatch contract more deeply: requested/default counts must fit inside `hatching.max_count`, animation capacity cannot exceed hatch capacity, debug history limits are positive, reveal badges have valid field types, shop max-count defaults stay within the configured hatch cap, and hatch-panel button labels must exist. `ConfigLoader.spec` covers the valid path plus count, animation, and UI-button failures.
- `EggService:SimulateHatchBatch` now provides a no-mutation server hatch simulation path for admin/testing. It rolls the same pet/variant/luck pipeline and returns costs, entitlements, option resolution, result samples, pet/variant/rarity counts, special counts, auto-delete matches, and animation metadata without spending currency, granting pets, incrementing stats, or playing client animation. Admin tools expose it and `EggHatchSimulationSmoke` verifies the non-mutation contract.
- The near-egg hatch panel now reflects effective hatch entitlements before a request is sent. It clamps the selected count to the same max-count source the server resolves from config/player attributes, exposes `MaxEntitledHatchCount` for testing/UI, and grays/blocks Auto when `AutoHatchUnlocked` is false.
- Hatch animation layout and special-result glow are now config-driven. `egg_system.hatching.animation.layout` controls grid padding and min/max egg sizes, `special_glow` controls the special rarity stroke/pulse, `EggHatchingService:GetActiveAnimationDebugState()` exposes the chosen layout/glow metadata, and `EggAnimationContractSmoke` verifies the client contract.
- Fast Hatch animation speed is now config-driven through `egg_system.hatching.animation.fast_hatch_speed_scale`. The animation debug state exposes resolved timing/options, and `EggAnimationContractSmoke` verifies that Fast/Silent hatch options use the configured scale.
- The near-egg hatch panel now persists the player's selected hatch count under `Settings.AutoSystems.hatch.selected_count`. `SettingsService` replicates it to `Player.Settings.AutoSystems.Hatch.SelectedCount`, the client restores it when the panel is created, and `EggProximitySmoke` verifies the replicated client/server round trip.
- Hatch mode preferences now persist under `Settings.AutoSystems.hatch.modes`. `SettingsService` sanitizes mode keys from `egg_system.ui.hatch_panel.modes`, replicates them under `Player.Settings.AutoSystems.Hatch.Modes`, and `EggInteractionService` restores/persists Golden, Charged, Fast, Skip, and Silent mode toggles without making the server trust those preferences for entitlement.
- The near-egg hatch panel now has config-driven responsive scaling. `egg_system.ui.hatch_panel.responsive` controls margin/min/max scale, `EggInteractionService:ComputeHatchPanelLayout()` exposes desktop/mobile fit math, and `EggProximitySmoke` verifies the panel remains full scale on desktop while fitting a mobile-width viewport.
- Hatch animation now has explicit max-batch coverage. `EggHatchingService` resolves a sane fallback viewport when Studio reports an uninitialized `1x1` camera size, exposes resolved container/frame geometry through `GetActiveAnimationDebugState()`, and `EggAnimationMaxBatchSmoke` verifies `99` authored egg frames fit in the compact `10x10` layout.
- Hatch mode education now includes config-derived economics. The hatch drawer reads mode cost/luck details from `egg_system.hatching.shop_stubs`, exposes them as UI attributes, and shows details such as Golden `20x` cost and Charged luck bonuses in help/status text.
- The expanded hatch drawer now has automated layout coverage. `EggProximitySmoke` opens the real `PlayerGui` drawer, verifies desktop/mobile fit math, and checks that visible drawer controls are not clipped inside the configured drawer bounds.
- Special hatch animation polish now has a config-driven backdrop layer. `egg_system.hatching.animation.special_backdrop` controls a rarity-colored reveal backdrop behind special pets, `ConfigLoader` validates its fields, and `EggAnimationContractSmoke` verifies the visual contract.
- Egg source unlock requirements now run through the server hatch pipeline. `EggService` checks `egg_sources.<id>.unlock_requirement` for real and simulated hatches, returns `egg_locked` with current/required progress, `ConfigLoader` validates the requirement shape, and `EggUnlockSmoke` verifies locked/unlocked golden egg behavior in Studio.
- Skip Hatch is now guarded at the animation service boundary too. `EggInteractionService` already avoids calling hatch animation when `skipHatch` is active, and `EggHatchingService` now immediately returns a completed skipped result without enabling the animation GUI or creating frames if a future caller passes `skipHatch`; `EggAnimationContractSmoke` verifies this contract.
- Show Hatch is now a free, persisted, default-on presentation preference. `egg_system.ui.hatch_panel.modes.show.default_enabled` seeds/migrates `Settings.AutoSystems.hatch.modes.showHatch`; turning it off suppresses hatch animations without needing the paid Skip Hatch entitlement, while Skip Hatch remains a separate hard animation suppressor.

Still to build:

- Richer near-egg hatch UI polish and direct Studio screenshot QA across desktop/mobile layouts when screenshot capture is available.
- Further hatch setting UI polish beyond the current config-derived mode cost/luck education, Max/Auto entitlement state, and dynamic hover/focus help text.
- Richer authored egg animation visual polish beyond the current ViewportFrame clone/scale/reveal-badge/glow/backdrop pass.
- Direct Studio screenshot QA across desktop/mobile layouts for the expanded hatch drawer when screenshot capture is available; current automated geometry coverage exists.

## Goal

Build eggs into a complete, config-first pet-simulator subsystem while keeping the server authoritative. Egg stands are authored map fixtures; egg behavior, costs, hatch modes, odds, variants, auto-delete, animation policy, and unlock rules live in config.

The designed hatch ceiling is `99` eggs. The hatch request should allow a desired count from `1` to `99`, but the server resolves the actual count from player entitlement, available currency, storage capacity, and egg settings. If the player asks for `99` and can afford/store `37`, hatch `37`; if the player can afford/store none, return a clear stop/error reason.

## Reference Findings

Pet Simulator X / 99 patterns worth adapting:

- Eggs are area/progression objects with cost, unlock requirement, and pet table.
- Multi-hatch is a first-class capability. This project should support any count `1..99`, not only fixed 3/9 progression steps.
- Auto-hatch is a loop state, not repeated manual clicking.
- Premium hatch modifiers include faster hatch, skip hatch, luck, huge/secret luck, Magic Eggs-style golden/rainbow chance, golden-only/charged modes, and additional egg slots.
- High-volume hatching depends on auto-delete/filtering so inventory and saves remain manageable.
- Special hatches need stronger reveal treatment when hatch animations are enabled. Skip Hatch is a hard player preference that hides the animation while auto-hatching; it should not be bypassed by special rarity outcomes.

ColorfulClickers patterns worth preserving conceptually:

- Single, triple, and nine hatch modes.
- Auto hatch loop near the current egg.
- Hatch speed scaling from Fast Egg-style ownership.
- Player settings for show/silence hatches and server hatch messages.
- Auto-delete by rarity.
- Special reveal fanfare for Secret/Exclusive/Huge/Colossal.
- The egg animation clones the actual world egg model, so authored eggs such as rocks can hatch as themselves.

## Core Architecture

Create one hatch pipeline:

1. Client requests `{ eggId, requestedCount, options, autoSessionId? }`.
2. Server validates target, distance, unlock, cooldown/lock, requested count, feature entitlement, currency, and storage.
3. Server resolves actual count, total cost, and stop reason. Counts above `99` are rejected or clamped by config; counts below affordable/storable capacity hatch partially only when the request allows partial hatches.
4. Server deducts once, rolls each pet, applies variant rolls, applies hatch enchants/auto-delete, grants pets through `PetGrantService`, increments stats, and returns a batch result.
5. Client plays one animation for the whole batch using the returned egg visual contract and result list.

The current spam bug should be fixed by a server-side per-player hatch lock. Cooldown should begin when the request is accepted, and the player should not be able to start another hatch until the server has finished validation/grants and the configured lock window has elapsed.

## Feature Buckets

Necessary:

- Server batch hatching for dynamic `1..99` counts.
- Server-side hatch lock and cooldown race fix.
- Config-driven hatch limits with max count, partial-hatch policy, required unlocks, and hotkey/button labels.
- Batch currency/storage validation before rolling.
- Batch result payload for animation, stats, auto-delete, and errors.
- Egg animation uses the authored egg model/anchor, not a generic icon.
- Tests for too-far, insufficient funds, insufficient storage, rapid repeat, single hatch, and multi-hatch.

High priority:

- Auto-hatch as a server-authorized client loop with stop reasons.
- Auto-delete UI for rarity/family/variant using the existing server filter foundation.
- Hatch UI near eggs: requested count selector/input, Hatch, Auto, Golden/Charged toggles where unlocked.
- Fast/skip/silent hatch settings.
- Special hatch fanfare rules by rarity/trait.
- Hatch history/debug panel for admin testing. First server/admin snapshot exists; future polish can make it a richer visual panel instead of a text result.

Config and balancing:

- `configs/egg_system.lua` should define max hatch count (`99`), partial hatch policy, lock/cooldown windows, animation policy, auto-hatch loop interval, and default UI/hotkeys.
- `configs/pets.lua` egg source entries should define base cost, currency, unlock/area, pet table, variant rolls, golden/charged modifiers, and visual model policy.
- `configs/upgrades.lua` / future monetization config can grant max requested hatch count, auto-hatch, fast hatch, skip hatch, luck, golden/rainbow chance, and huge/secret luck modifiers.

## Comprehensive Implementation Checklist

Server pipeline:

- Add a canonical `EggHatchService` or refactor `EggService` into clearly separated helpers: validate request, resolve count, charge currency, roll pets, grant pets, build response.
- Replace legacy `purchaseType` strings with `{ requestedCount, options }` while preserving a temporary compatibility adapter for current UI/tests.
- Add per-player hatch lock state with accepted-at time, active request id, and release timing.
- Make hatch lock cover the whole server transaction so rapid `E` presses cannot create invisible hatches.
- Add consistent result envelopes: `{ ok = true, eggId, requestedCount, hatchCount, totalCost, currency, results, animation, autoDeleted, stopReason }` and `{ ok = false, code, message, details }`.
- Support partial hatching: requested `99`, affordable/storable `N`, hatch `N` when `allow_partial = true`; otherwise reject.
- Validate distance using `EggWorldQuery` and authored `EggStand` anchors.
- Validate area/zone unlocks for eggs if configured. First-pass counter/stat unlock requirements are enforced through `egg_sources.<id>.unlock_requirement`; richer area/zone prerequisite checks can build on the same server gate.
- Validate storage against stackable vs unique pet storage rules.
- Deduct total currency once per batch with economy source metadata such as `egg_hatch_batch`.
- Roll each hatch independently using current pet + variant + luck/enchant logic.
- Apply hatch-time enchants only through `PetGrantService`.
- Apply auto-delete before inventory write, preserving protected rarity rules.
- Increment `eggs_hatched` by actual hatch count.
- Return per-result metadata for rarity, variant, unique id, serial, auto-delete status, and display names.
- Add admin/server utility to simulate hatch batches without client animation. First-pass `EggService:SimulateHatchBatch`, admin panel button, and Studio smoke now exist.

Config:

- Add `egg_system.hatching.max_count = 99`.
- Add `egg_system.hatching.allow_partial = true`.
- Add `egg_system.hatching.default_requested_count = 1`; per-player selected-count persistence now lives under `Settings.AutoSystems.hatch.selected_count`.
- Add `egg_system.hatching.cooldown_seconds`, `lock_release_policy`, and `auto_loop_delay`.
- Add `egg_system.hatching.compat_purchase_types` for temporary `"Single"`, `"Triple"`, and `"Auto"` mapping during migration.
- Add `egg_system.ui.hatch_controls` for button visibility, labels, count selector, and hotkeys.
- Add `egg_system.animation` for show/skip/silent/special-reveal rules, speed multipliers, and max supported count.
- Extend config validation for max count, partial policy, animation max, and hatch-control fields.
- Add shop/entitlement stub config for max hatch count, auto hatch, fast hatch, skip hatch, golden mode, charged mode, and luck sources.

Client UI:

- Replace single `E` behavior with a hatch controller that tracks selected/requested count.
- Add near-egg controls for Hatch, Auto, selected count, and future mode toggles.
- Add keyboard support that remains simple: `E` hatch selected count; optional key for auto hatch.
- Disable/gray controls while the server hatch lock is active.
- Show exact stop reasons: no funds, no storage, too far, locked area, on cooldown, feature locked.
- Add auto-hatch state UI with visible running/stopped reason.
- Add auto-delete filter UI backed by existing server settings: rarity, pet family, variant, protected tiers.
- Add settings for show hatch, skip hatch, silence hatch, and fast hatch once entitlement stubs exist. First-pass persistent mode settings and help text exist, and Show Hatch now works as a default-on free presentation preference. Future polish should make locked/unlocked ownership more explicit.

Animation:

- Feed `EggHatchingService` a list of `1..99` result entries.
- Use the authored egg visual from the current `EggStand`/world model when available, including rock-style placeholder eggs.
- Keep fallback generated egg visuals for synthetic maps.
- Support dynamic count layouts up to `99`.
- Add stronger reveal metadata/effects for protected/special tiers when hatch animation is shown. Skip Hatch suppresses the hatch animation entirely at both interaction and animation-service boundaries; Silent Hatch suppresses audio while config can decide whether special visual-only world FX still plays.
- Include per-result rarity/variant colors and special effects.
- Ensure animation completion/reentry does not control server correctness; it only controls client presentation.
- Keep animation presentation choices configurable: grid layout sizes/padding, authored egg scale, reveal badges, special glow/backdrop, and future special effects should live in config rather than hardcoded UI constants.
- Fast Hatch speed should remain a config value, not a hardcoded client multiplier; current validation requires it to be positive and no slower than normal speed.

Auto hatch:

- Implement auto hatch as a client loop that repeatedly asks the server while the same egg remains valid.
- Give each auto session a token/session id so stale responses do not restart a stopped loop.
- Stop on no funds, no storage, too far, egg changed, area locked, server error, or manual cancel.
- Use the selected requested count; default can be max allowed/requested count.
- Respect hatch lock and server cooldown instead of trying to time it only on the client.

Shop and entitlement stubs:

- Add a server-side entitlement resolver that initially reads dev/test config and player attributes/profile settings.
- Stub entitlements for `max_hatch_count`, `auto_hatch`, `fast_hatch`, `skip_hatch`, `golden_mode`, `charged_mode`, `luck_bonus`, `secret_luck_bonus`.
- Do not require the shop UI to exist yet; expose admin/dev commands or config flags to toggle entitlements for testing. The first admin panel controls now exist, but the future shop should call the same entitlement source instead of hardcoding egg behavior.
- Later shop/monetization should call the same entitlement resolver, not change egg code.

Testing:

- Unit/config tests for hatch max count relationships, animation capacity, UI button config, partial count, cost math, and invalid config. First-pass `ConfigLoader.spec` coverage exists for the config-shape pieces; service smokes cover partial count and cost math.
- Studio smoke: far hatch rejects.
- Studio smoke: single hatch succeeds and saves.
- Studio smoke: rapid `E` returns cooldown/locked and never creates invisible hatches.
- Studio smoke: requested `99` with limited funds hatches affordable count.
- Studio smoke: requested `99` with limited storage hatches storable count.
- Studio smoke: auto-delete prevents inventory writes but increments hatch stats.
- Studio smoke: auto hatch stops on no funds/storage/too far.
- Studio smoke: authored egg animation payload names/uses the current rock egg.
- Studio smoke: configured egg unlock requirements reject below the threshold and hatch once the counter/stat requirement is met. `EggUnlockSmoke` covers the first counter-backed path.
- Studio smoke: admin hatch entitlement controls can lock/unlock/reset shop stubs and max hatch count.
- Studio smoke: no-mutation hatch simulation returns costs/counts/results without changing currency, inventory, or hatch stats.
- Studio smoke: near-egg panel reports effective max hatch entitlement and locked Auto state before the server request. `EggProximitySmoke` covers this first Max/Auto entitlement UI contract.
- Studio smoke: hatch animation debug state exposes configured grid layout and special glow pulse metadata. `EggAnimationContractSmoke` covers the current client-side contract.
- Studio smoke: Fast/Silent hatch timing metadata matches config. `EggAnimationContractSmoke` covers the current client-side timing contract.
- Studio smoke: maximum `99`-egg authored animation fits on the resolved animation viewport. `EggAnimationMaxBatchSmoke` covers the compact `10x10` contract and authored visual use.
- Regression: existing egg proximity, pet grant, pet index, achievements, and leaderboards still pass.

Documentation:

- Update current status after each major slice.
- Keep `EGG_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` current as decisions firm up.
- Add an egg authoring section to map workflow docs.
- Add admin testing instructions for dynamic hatch counts and entitlement stubs.

Later polish:

- Area-specific currencies/materials for eggs.
- Egg mastery or hatch milestones.
- Pity/mercy counters if desired for event/secret balancing.
- Public hatch announcements for rare tiers.
- Party/shared hatch visibility.
- Premium/event eggs with stricter odds disclosure and no hidden client-side luck drift.

## Implementation Order

1. Harden current single hatch: server lock, consistent error response, current authored egg visual payload.
2. Replace `purchaseType` strings with dynamic requested counts and server batch result.
3. Add selected-count UI and batch animation for `1..99`.
4. Add auto-hatch loop with stop reasons and server/session guard.
5. Add full auto-delete/filter UI and hatch settings.
6. Add golden/charged mode toggles and balance hooks.
7. Add smoke tests and admin tools for every mode. First-pass admin hatch entitlement controls are in place; keep expanding coverage as future hatch settings become real shop/upgrades.

## Open Questions

- Should the default selected count be `1`, player preference, or max affordable/storable up to max allowed?
- Should multi-hatch count entitlement default to `99` during template development, then be tuned later by game-specific config/shop?
- Resolved: Golden and Charged mode have first-pass config/server/client/test paths. Balance values remain template defaults.
- Resolved: Skip Hatch is specifically an animation-suppression preference for auto-hatching and should not be overridden by special hatch outcomes. Special hatches can still carry reveal metadata and stronger effects when animations are enabled.
- Should area currencies replace coins/crystals entirely per area, or should core currency stay global with area materials as side currencies?
