# Project Wiki

This is the living project wiki for the RBX Template pet/clicker game. It follows the LLM Wiki pattern: raw/reference material is preserved, and agents maintain concise Markdown pages that compile current project knowledge.

## Start Here

- [Current Status](CURRENT_STATUS.md) — what exists right now.
- [Decisions](DECISIONS.md) — durable decisions and rationale.
- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — system shape and service boundaries.
- [Pet Inventory SSOT](PET_INVENTORY_SSOT.md) — the single-source-of-truth pet model: ownership in `Inventory.pets.items`, equip as a separate validated layer. Read before touching pet inventory/equip/trade.
- [Studio Workflow](STUDIO_WORKFLOW.md) — Rojo, Roblox Studio, MCP, and verification workflow.
- [Remote Dev Pipeline](REMOTE_DEV_PIPELINE.md) — develop → test → build → release from a CLI/AI agent; the layered testing methodology and hard-limit gap analysis.
- [Automation API Design](AUTOMATION_API_DESIGN.md) — the CommandBus boundary, GameAPIService, and AutomationService that let tests drive the game below the GUI.
- [Map Integration Contract](MAP_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) — how Rojo systems bind to Studio-authored worlds.
- [Egg System Plan](EGG_SYSTEM_PLAN.md) — planned hatch modes, auto hatch, multi hatch, animation, and egg config architecture.
- [Reference Game Insights](REFERENCE_GAME_INSIGHTS.md) — useful ideas from ColorfulClickers.
- [Open Questions](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) — decisions still pending.
- [Log](LOG.md) — dated session notes.
- [Schema](SCHEMA.md) — how to maintain this wiki.

## Source Documents

Formal requirements and plans live outside the wiki and should be treated as source material:

- [Foundation & Requirements](../FOUNDATION_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Implementation Plan](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [Asset Pipeline](../ASSET_PIPELINE.md)
- [Map Marker Reference](../MAP_MARKER_REFERENCE.md)
- [Egg Authoring And Admin Testing](../EGG_AUTHORING_AND_ADMIN_TESTING.md)

## Maintenance Rule

When code, configs, requirements, or Studio workflow decisions change in a way a future agent would need to know, update the relevant wiki page before finishing the task.
