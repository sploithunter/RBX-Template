## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week):
1. **Complete UI System Foundation**
   - Create base components (Button, Panel, CurrencyDisplay)
   - Implement screen management system
   - Add inventory and shop interfaces

2. **Test Current Systems**
   - Verify effect persistence across server restarts
   - Test multi-currency transactions
   - Validate rate limiting with effects
   - Check ProfileStore data integrity

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Complete code examples in SAMPLE_CODE.md
   - Update troubleshooting guide
   - Document UI component usage

### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Weeks):
1. **Matter ECS Implementation**
   - Define components for chosen game mode
   - Implement core systems (movement, health, inventory)
   - Integrate with existing services

2. **Game Mode Specialization**
   - Choose primary game mode (Simulator recommended)
   - Implement mode-specific systems
   - Create progression mechanics

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Trading system framework
   - Social features foundation
   - Analytics preparation

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Before Each Development Session:
- [ ] Verify Rojo server is running (`rojo serve`)
- [ ] Check Studio connection to Rojo
- [ ] Run basic functionality tests
- [ ] Check for errors in Studio output

### After Major Changes:
- [ ] Test with multiple players in Studio
- [ ] Verify data persistence (leave/rejoin game)
- [ ] Check effect calculations are correct
- [ ] Validate network packet flow
- [ ] Run any existing unit tests

### Before Committing Code:
- [ ] No errors or warnings in Studio output
- [ ] All new features tested in multi-player
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (check frame time)
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Gotchas

1. **Configuration Changes**: After modifying configs, restart the game to reload
2. **ProfileStore**: Always test data persistence by leaving/rejoining
3. **Effects**: Verify aggregates recalculate correctly after effect expiry
4. **Network**: Rate limiting can prevent rapid testing - adjust limits in dev
5. **Matter ECS**: Systems run each frame - watch for performance issues

---

## ðŸ“‹ Definition of Done

A feature is considered complete when:
- [ ] Implemented according to architecture patterns
- [ ] Tested with multiple players
- [ ] Data persists correctly in ProfileStore
- [ ] No errors or warnings in output
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] Configuration-driven where applicable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code committed to git

This checklist ensures systematic development while maintaining the quality and architecture principles of the game template.
