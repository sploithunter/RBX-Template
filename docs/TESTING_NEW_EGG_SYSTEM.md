# Testing the New Egg System

ðŸŽ¯ **Quick test guide for the distance-based egg interaction system**

## What I Fixed

The infinite yield issue was caused by timing - the client was trying to connect to the `EggPurchase` RemoteEvent before the server created it.

### âœ… **Changes Made:**
1. **Graceful RemoteEvent handling** - Client waits with timeout instead of infinite yield
2. **Faster server initialization** - Reduced delay from 0.5s to 0.1s  
3. **Better error handling** - Shows "Server not ready" if RemoteEvent unavailable
4. **Increased starting coins** - Now gives 2000 coins for testing (was 500)

## Quick Test Steps

### **1. Restart the Game**
- Stop current game session
- Run again to get the fixes

### **2. Watch the Logs**
You should see these messages in order:

```
âœ… EggInteractionService: Initializing distance-based interaction system...
âœ… EggInteractionService: Proximity loop started  
âœ… EggInteractionService: Setting up server responses...
âœ… [INFO] EggPurchaseService initializing...
âœ… [INFO] Created EggPurchase RemoteEvent
âœ… EggInteractionService: Connected to EggPurchase RemoteEvent
```

### **3. Test the Interaction**
1. **Walk near your BasicEgg** (within 20 studs)
2. **Look for indicator**: "Press E to open Basic Egg" 
3. **Press E** to trigger purchase
4. **Check console** for purchase result

## Expected Success Flow

### **When Near Egg:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Now near egg: Basic Egg
```

### **When E Key Pressed:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ E KEY PRESSED! Current egg: Basic Egg
âœ… Player wants to purchase Basic Egg
```

### **Server Processing:**
```
[INFO] Egg purchase requested {"player":"coloradoplays","eggType":"basic_egg"}
[DEBUG] Distance check {"distance":8.5,"maxDistance":20}
[DEBUG] Currency check {"currency":"coins","currentAmount":2000,"cost":100}
[INFO] Currency deducted {"cost":100,"newAmount":1900}
[INFO] Egg hatched successfully {"pet":"bear","variant":"basic","power":10}
```

### **Client Success:**
```
âœ… Purchase successful!
Hatched: basic bear with 10 power!
```

## Troubleshooting

### **If "Server not ready" error:**
- Server initialization is slow
- Check server logs for EggPurchaseService errors
- Wait a few more seconds and try again

### **If "Too far away" error:**
- Move closer to the egg (within 20 studs)
- Make sure you have an `EggSpawnPoint` part in workspace

### **If "Insufficient coins" error:**
- Check: `game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetAttribute("Coins")`
- Should show 2000 (auto-given to new players)

### **If no proximity indicator:**
- Check that you have an EggSpawnPoint with `EggType = "basic_egg"`
- Restart the game to ensure egg spawned

## Current Status

The system should now work reliably:

- âœ… **No more infinite yield**
- âœ… **Graceful error handling** 
- âœ… **Proper server/client timing**
- âœ… **Sufficient test currency**
- âœ… **Distance-based interaction**

**Try it out and let me know what you see!** ðŸš€

## Debug Commands

If you need to debug further:

```lua
-- Check current currency
print("Coins:", game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetAttribute("Coins"))

-- Check if RemoteEvent exists
print("RemoteEvent exists:", game.ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("EggPurchase") ~= nil)

-- Check current egg
-- (This would need to be added to the service for external access)
```

The core interaction should work now! ðŸŽ®
