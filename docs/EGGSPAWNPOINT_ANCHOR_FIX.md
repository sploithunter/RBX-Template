# EggSpawnPoint Anchor Fix

## **🎯 Problem Solved:**

**Issue**: Constant warnings `"Egg missing UIanchor"` every 0.05 seconds because spawned eggs didn't have the `UIanchor` part that the working game pattern expects.

**User's Solution**: "you could just use EggSpawnPoint..."

## **✅ Much Better Approach:**

Instead of creating new `UIanchor` parts, I updated all services to use the existing `EggSpawnPoint` part as the anchor point for distance calculations and UI positioning.

## **🔧 Changes Made:**

### **1. EggSpawner.lua**
- **Removed**: UIanchor part creation
- **Kept**: Simple metadata (EggType, SpawnPoint reference)

### **2. EggCurrentTargetService.lua**
- **Changed**: `obj:FindFirstChild("UIanchor")` → Use `SpawnPoint` ObjectValue
- **Logic**: Gets anchor from `egg.SpawnPoint.Value` (the EggSpawnPoint part)
- **Fallback**: PrimaryPart or any Part if SpawnPoint missing

### **3. EggInteractionService.lua**
- **Changed**: Distance check now uses EggSpawnPoint as anchor
- **Same pattern**: SpawnPoint ObjectValue → actual EggSpawnPoint part

### **4. EggService.lua**
- **Changed**: Server-side distance validation uses EggSpawnPoint
- **Consistent**: Same anchor logic across client and server

## **📍 How It Works:**

```lua
-- Each spawned egg has a SpawnPoint ObjectValue that references the EggSpawnPoint
local spawnPointRef = egg:FindFirstChild("SpawnPoint")
local anchor = spawnPointRef and spawnPointRef.Value  -- This is the EggSpawnPoint part

-- Use this for distance calculations and UI positioning
local distance = (playerPos - anchor.Position).Magnitude
```

## **🎮 Benefits:**

✅ **No unnecessary parts** - Uses existing EggSpawnPoint infrastructure  
✅ **No more warnings** - System finds proper anchor points  
✅ **Consistent distance** - All calculations use same reference point  
✅ **Simpler code** - No part creation in EggSpawner  
✅ **Reliable positioning** - UI appears at spawn point location  

## **🚀 Expected Result:**

**Restart your game** and you should see:

1. **No more "Egg missing UIanchor" warnings** ✅
2. **UI appears when near EggSpawnPoint** (10 stud range) ✅
3. **Distance calculations work properly** ✅
4. **E key purchasing functions** ✅

Much cleaner solution! 🎯
