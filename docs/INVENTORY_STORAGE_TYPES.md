# Inventory Storage Types - Design Document

## üéØ Purpose

This document explains the two storage approaches for inventory items: **Stackable** (identical items) vs **Unique** (individual instances with unique properties).

---

## üì¶ Storage Type Comparison

### **Stackable Items (storage_type: "stackable")**

**Use Case**: Items that are functionally identical
- Coins, potions, resources, consumables
- No individual properties or uniqueness needed
- Efficient storage via quantity counts

**Storage Structure**:
```lua
bucket.items = {
    ["health_potion"] = {
        id = "health_potion",
        quantity = 15,               -- Player has 15 health potions
        obtained_at = 1701234567
    },
    ["wood"] = {
        id = "wood", 
        quantity = 250,              -- Player has 250 wood
        obtained_at = 1701234568,
        quality = "oak"              -- Optional properties still allowed
    }
}
```

**Slot Usage**: Each unique item type takes 1 slot regardless of quantity
- 15 health potions = 1 slot
- 250 wood = 1 slot  
- Total slots used = 2 (out of bucket limit)

### **Unique Items (storage_type: "unique")**

**Use Case**: Items with individual properties and progression
- Pets, weapons, armor, collectibles
- Each instance has unique stats, levels, enchantments
- Requires individual tracking

**Storage Structure**:
```lua
bucket.items = {
    ["pet_1701234567_a3f8b2c1"] = {
        id = "bear",                 -- Base pet type
        variant = "golden",          -- This bear is golden
        level = 5,                   -- Individual level
        exp = 250,                   -- Individual experience
        nickname = "Goldie",         -- Player-given name
        stats = {
            power = 55,              -- Unique stats due to level/enchantments
            health = 780,
            speed = 1.2
        },
        enchantments = {
            {type = "power_boost", tier = 1, value = 5}
        },
        obtained_at = 1701234567
    },
    ["pet_1701234568_d9e4f7a2"] = {
        id = "bear",                 -- Same type as above...
        variant = "basic",           -- But different variant
        level = 1,                   -- Different level
        exp = 0,                     -- Different experience
        nickname = "Bruno",          -- Different nickname
        stats = {
            power = 50,              -- Different stats
            health = 600,
            speed = 1.0
        },
        enchantments = {},           -- No enchantments
        obtained_at = 1701234568
    }
}
```

**Slot Usage**: Each individual item takes 1 slot
- Golden Bear "Goldie" = 1 slot
- Basic Bear "Bruno" = 1 slot
- Total slots used = 2 (out of bucket limit)

## üîÑ Real-World Examples

### **Pet Simulator Game**

**Pets Bucket (Unique Storage)**:
```lua
pets = {
    storage_type = "unique",
    base_limit = 50,
    items = {
        ["pet_001"] = {id = "bear", variant = "golden", level = 10, power = 85},
        ["pet_002"] = {id = "bear", variant = "basic", level = 3, power = 45},
        ["pet_003"] = {id = "dragon", variant = "fire", level = 7, power = 120},
        ["pet_004"] = {id = "bear", variant = "rainbow", level = 15, power = 200}
    }
}
-- 4 slots used: Each pet is unique despite some being same type
```

**Consumables Bucket (Stackable Storage)**:
```lua
consumables = {
    storage_type = "stackable", 
    base_limit = 100,
    items = {
        ["health_potion"] = {quantity = 25},
        ["speed_potion"] = {quantity = 12},
        ["luck_potion"] = {quantity = 8}
    }
}
-- 3 slots used: Each potion type takes 1 slot regardless of quantity
```

**Resources Bucket (Stackable Storage)**:
```lua
resources = {
    storage_type = "stackable",
    base_limit = 50, 
    items = {
        ["wood"] = {quantity = 1500},
        ["stone"] = {quantity = 800},
        ["iron"] = {quantity = 200},
        ["diamond"] = {quantity = 15}
    }
}
-- 4 slots used: Each resource type takes 1 slot
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Design Benefits

### **Storage Efficiency**
- **Stackable**: 1000 coins = 1 slot
- **Unique**: 1000 pets = 1000 slots (if all unique)

### **Scalability**
- **Stackable**: Player can have millions of coins without affecting performance
- **Unique**: Each pet has individual data, allowing complex progression systems

### **Flexibility**
- **Stackable items** can still have optional properties (quality, source, etc.)
- **Unique items** can share base configurations while maintaining individuality

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### **When to Use Stackable**
- ‚úÖ Items are functionally identical
- ‚úÖ No individual progression/stats needed
- ‚úÖ Large quantities expected
- ‚úÖ Simple gameplay mechanics

**Examples**: Currency, basic consumables, crafting materials, ammo

### **When to Use Unique** 
- ‚úÖ Individual progression/leveling
- ‚úÖ Unique stats or properties per instance
- ‚úÖ Player customization (nicknames, enchantments)
- ‚úÖ Complex gameplay mechanics

**Examples**: Pets, weapons, armor, vehicles, collectibles

### **Configuration Example**
```lua
buckets = {
    -- Unique storage for complex items
    pets = {
        storage_type = "unique",
        base_limit = 50,
        stack_size = 1              -- Each pet takes 1 slot
    },
    
    -- Stackable storage for simple items  
    consumables = {
        storage_type = "stackable",
        base_limit = 100,
        stack_size = 99             -- Up to 99 per stack
    }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Considerations

Both storage types follow the same safety principles:
- ‚úÖ Buckets never deleted from profiles
- ‚úÖ Data preserved during migrations
- ‚úÖ Orphaned buckets detected but preserved
- ‚úÖ Configuration changes only add, never remove

The storage type affects HOW items are stored within buckets, but doesn't change the bucket preservation safety system.

This dual approach provides the perfect balance: efficiency for simple items, flexibility for complex items, all within the same unified inventory system.
