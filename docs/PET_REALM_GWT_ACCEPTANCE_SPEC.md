# Pet Realm Game — Given-When-Then Acceptance Specification

**Companion document to:** `DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`
**Purpose:** Behavior specification in Given-When-Then (Gherkin-flavored) format. Each scenario serves dual purpose: (1) unambiguous functional architecture, (2) executable acceptance test specification.
**Test framework target:** TestEZ for unit/integration, Studio command-bar runners for end-to-end (existing RBX-Template patterns).

---

## 0. How To Use This Document

Each **Feature** in this document maps to a system from the design doc. Each **Scenario** within a feature is a single, deterministic behavior specification.

### Scenario Format

All scenarios follow Gherkin convention:
- `Given` — preconditions, world state, player state
- `When` — the triggering action
- `Then` — required outcome (single observable change)
- `And` — additional related outcomes
- `But` — explicit negative outcomes (things that must NOT happen)

### Test Level Tags

Each scenario is tagged with its target test level:
- **[unit]** — pure logic, no Roblox services required, TestEZ in `tests/unit/`
- **[integration]** — touches ProfileStore, modifier pipeline, multiple services, TestEZ in `tests/integration/`
- **[studio]** — requires real player/world state, Studio command-bar runner in `tests/studio/`

### Status Marking

- **[required]** — must implement and pass
- **[deferred]** — agreed behavior, defer implementation to later phase
- **[open]** — design question, behavior not yet finalized

### How To Convert To Test Code

Each scenario maps roughly to one `it` block in TestEZ:

```lua
describe("Soul stat", function()
    it("increases by 5 when player conquers clockwise neighbor", function()
        -- Given
        local profile = makeProfile({ soul = 0, last_conquered = "earth" })
        -- When
        AlignmentService:onBiomeConquest(profile, "desert")
        -- Then
        expect(profile.soul).to.equal(5)
    end)
end)
```

The Given/When/Then mapping is mechanical. Studio scenarios follow the existing `Phase5AutoSystemsSmoke` pattern.

### Reading Convention

Scenarios assume the player and world state is in a consistent starting condition unless otherwise noted in `Background`. Anything not specified in `Given` should be treated as default/empty.

## Feature 1: Ring Map Topology

**System:** map/world | **Existing code reference:** `configs/areas.lua`, `configs/markers.lua`
**Description:** The map is a ring of biomes with deterministic adjacency. Biome order and themes are config-driven; service code must not hardcode.

### Background

```gherkin
Given the prototype config defines biomes in clockwise order: [earth, ice, lava, desert, beach]
And each biome has a theme tag matching its name
And the Central Hub is at the ring center
```

### Scenario: Biome adjacency lookup — clockwise neighbor [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a biome named "earth"
When the system queries the clockwise neighbor of "earth"
Then it should return "ice"
```

### Scenario: Biome adjacency lookup — counterclockwise neighbor [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a biome named "earth"
When the system queries the counterclockwise neighbor of "earth"
Then it should return "beach"
```

### Scenario: Biome adjacency wraps around the ring [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a biome named "beach" which is the last in clockwise order
When the system queries the clockwise neighbor of "beach"
Then it should return "earth" (wrapping to the start)
```

### Scenario: Biome theme is config-driven, not inferred [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a biome config entry { id: "ice", theme: "ice" }
When the system queries the theme of biome "ice"
Then it should return "ice"
But the system must not hardcode any biome-to-theme mapping in service code
```

### Scenario: Adding a biome to config does not require service code changes [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given the existing ring has 5 biomes
When a developer adds a 6th biome "swamp" to configs/areas.lua
And the developer rebuilds the place
Then the new biome appears in the ring topology
And adjacency lookups correctly include "swamp"
And no service code modification was required
```

### Scenario: Biome theme dichotomies are config-driven [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the prototype config defines dichotomies: earth↔desert, ice↔lava
When the system queries the dichotomy partner of "earth"
Then it should return "desert"
And queries for "ice" return "lava"
And queries for "beach" (no dichotomy) return nil
```

## Feature 2: Soul Stat (Alignment Tracking)

**System:** `AlignmentService` (new) | **Persistence:** ProfileStore field `soul`
**Description:** Tracks the player's alignment along Heaven (positive) / Hell (negative) axis. Updated on biome conquest based on directional progression.

### Background

```gherkin
Given a player with profile.soul = 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome = nil
And the ring biome order is [earth, ice, lava, desert, beach] (clockwise)
And the per-conquest Soul delta is configured as 5
And the Soul range is configured as [-100, +100]
```

### Scenario: Initial Soul stat is zero [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a newly created player profile
When the profile is loaded
Then profile.soul should equal 0
```

### Scenario: Conquering clockwise neighbor increases Soul [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers "ice" (clockwise neighbor of earth)
Then profile.soul should equal 5
And profile.last_conquered_biome should equal "ice"
```

### Scenario: Conquering counterclockwise neighbor decreases Soul [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers "beach" (counterclockwise neighbor of earth)
Then profile.soul should equal -5
And profile.last_conquered_biome should equal "beach"
```

### Scenario: Conquering non-adjacent biome does not change Soul [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 10
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers "lava" (not adjacent to earth)
Then profile.soul should remain 10
And profile.last_conquered_biome should equal "lava"
```

### Scenario: First conquest has no last_conquered, no Soul change [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome = nil
When the player conquers their first biome "earth"
Then profile.soul should remain 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome should equal "earth"
```

### Scenario: Re-conquering an already-conquered biome does not affect Soul [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 15
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "ice"
And profile.conquered_biomes includes "earth"
When the player re-enters and "completes" earth content
Then profile.soul should remain 15
And the conquest event should not fire
```

### Scenario: Soul is capped at upper bound [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = 98
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers a clockwise neighbor (delta +5)
Then profile.soul should equal 100 (capped, not 103)
```

### Scenario: Soul is capped at lower bound [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given profile.soul = -98
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers a counterclockwise neighbor (delta -5)
Then profile.soul should equal -100 (capped, not -103)
```

### Scenario: HUD displays current Soul value [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player with profile.soul = 42
When the player joins the game
Then the Soul HUD element should display a value tilted toward Light
And the visual representation should match 42/100 of the positive direction
```

### Scenario: Soul updates are visible in HUD in real time [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player in-game with profile.soul = 0
And the HUD Soul meter is visible at zero
When the player conquers a clockwise-neighbor biome
Then within 1 second the HUD should reflect soul = 5
And a brief notification "Your soul tilts toward the Light..." should appear
```

### Scenario: Soul delta value is config-driven [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the config sets soul_delta_per_conquest = 10 (instead of 5)
And profile.soul = 0
And profile.last_conquered_biome = "earth"
When the player conquers a clockwise neighbor
Then profile.soul should equal 10
```

### Scenario: Soul value persists across sessions [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player with profile.soul = 35
When the player logs out
And the player logs back in
Then profile.soul should still equal 35
```

```gherkin
Given a player in the Heaven 1 Earth biome
And the breakable's base reward is 10 earth_coins
And Heaven 1 multiplier is 1.5×

```

### Scenario: Earth biome breakable in Hell 1 drops earth coins (not separate currency) [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player in the Hell 1 Earth biome
And the breakable's base reward is 10 earth_coins
And Hell 1 multiplier is 1.5×
When the player destroys the breakable
Then profile.earth_coins should increase by 15
But no separate "cursed earth coins" should be created
```

### Scenario: Currency drops vary by biome [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player destroying breakables across biomes
When the player destroys a breakable in earth biome
Then they receive earth_coins
When the player destroys a breakable in ice biome
Then they receive ice_coins

```

### Scenario: Currencies cannot be transferred between players [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given two players in a trade window
And player A has 1000 earth_coins
When player A attempts to add earth_coins to the trade
Then the trade UI should reject the addition
And display "Currencies cannot be traded"
```

### Scenario: Currencies cannot be exfiltrated via API exploits [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a client sends a fabricated currency-transfer RemoteEvent
When the server receives the event
Then the server should reject the request
And log the attempt for security review
```

### Scenario: Light Tokens drop only from Heaven layer activities [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player destroying breakables in Heaven 1 biomes
When the player destroys breakables
Then profile.light_tokens should increase
But destroying breakables in base or Hell layers should not increase light_tokens
```

### Scenario: Shadow Tokens drop only from Hell layer activities [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player destroying breakables/enemies in Hell layers
When the player destroys enemies
Then profile.shadow_tokens should increase
But activities in base or Heaven layers should not increase shadow_tokens

## Feature 5: Pet Element Assignment

**System:** extends `PetGrantService` | **Existing code reference:** `configs/pets.lua`, PetGrantService
**Description:** Pets gain an element tag at hatch time based on the layer where the hatch occurred.

### Background

```gherkin
Given hatching in base layer assigns element "neutral"
And hatching in any Heaven layer assigns element "light"
And hatching in any Hell layer assigns element "shadow"
And Chaotic element is never assigned at hatch (only via fusion)
```

### Scenario: Pet hatched in base layer has neutral element [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player in base layer with currency for hatching
When the player hatches an egg
Then the resulting pet record should have element = "neutral"
```

### Scenario: Pet hatched in Heaven layer has light element [integration] [required]

```

### Scenario: Element is immutable after hatch (except via fusion) [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a pet with element = "light"
When any non-fusion action is taken (level up, enchant, equip, trade)
Then pet.element should remain "light"
```

### Scenario: Stacked pets inherit current hatch-layer element [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player owns a stack: { pet_id: "frost_drake", element: "light", count: 10 }

When the player hatches another "frost_drake" type
Then the new pet does NOT merge into the existing stack
And the new pet starts a new stack with element = "shadow"
And the player now has two stacks: { ...light, count:10 } and { ...shadow, count:1 }
```

### Scenario: Variant remains independent of element [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a pet with element = "light"
When the player applies a "gold" variant upgrade
Then pet.element should remain "light"
And pet.variant should become "gold"
```

```

### Scenario: Power is never persisted to pet record [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a pet record loaded from ProfileStore
When the system inspects the pet record's fields
Then no field named "power", "calculated_power", or similar should exist
And only identity + mutable state fields should be present
```

### Scenario: Power recalculates dynamically when player changes biome [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player in Heaven 1 with a pet at calculated power = 120

```

### Scenario: Pet enters Spirit Form after taking sufficient damage [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet in active squad in a Hell biome
And the pet has full health
When the pet takes damage equal to its max HP
Then the pet should transition to "Spirit Form"
And the pet record should have lastDownedAt = current timestamp
And the pet should be removed from active squad
And the pet should appear in inventory with a spirit-form visual indicator
```

### Scenario: Pet in Spirit Form cannot be deployed during cooldown [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet with lastDownedAt = 1000 seconds ago
And the pet's cooldown_seconds = 300 (mid-tier)
When the player attempts to deploy the pet to active squad
Then the deployment should be rejected
And an error message "Pet is still in spirit form" should be shown
```

### Scenario: Pet becomes deployable after cooldown elapses [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet with lastDownedAt = 400 seconds ago
And the pet's cooldown_seconds = 300
When the player attempts to deploy the pet
Then the deployment should succeed
And the pet should appear in active squad
And the pet's state should be "Healthy"
```

### Scenario: Cooldown is halved in Heaven biomes [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet with lastDownedAt = current timestamp
And the pet's cooldown_seconds = 300
And the player is in a Heaven biome
When the system computes effective cooldown
Then the effective cooldown should be 150 seconds (300 / 2)
```

### Scenario: Cooldown timing matches content tier where pet was downed [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet is in active squad during a boss fight (content_tier = boss, cooldown = 1800)
When the pet is downed during the boss fight
Then the pet's cooldown_seconds should be set to 1800
And not the lower mid-tier or trash-mob value
```

### Scenario: Staged degradation transitions are visible [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet with full HP in combat
When the pet's HP drops below 75% threshold
Then the pet's visible state should change to "Strained"
And a subtle aura/glow change should be visible
When the pet's HP drops below 25% threshold
Then the pet's visible state should change to "Critical"
And a warning UI element should appear
When the pet's HP reaches 0
Then the pet should transition to "Spirit Form" as in earlier scenario
```

### Scenario: Player can recall a Critical pet to prevent Spirit Form [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet in active squad with state = "Critical"
When the player issues a Recall command (e.g., hotbar tactical command)
Then the pet should return to bench
And the pet should retain its current HP (not regenerate immediately)
And the pet should NOT enter Spirit Form
```

### Scenario: Instant-recharge consumable removes cooldown [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet in Spirit Form with lastDownedAt = current timestamp

When the player uses the consumable on the pet
Then the pet's lastDownedAt should be set to nil
And the pet should be immediately deployable
And the consumable count should decrease by 1
```

### Scenario: Cooldown timestamps persist across sessions [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a unique pet with lastDownedAt = some_past_timestamp
When the player logs out and back in
Then the pet's lastDownedAt should still equal some_past_timestamp
And the effective cooldown calculation should account for time elapsed during logout
```

### Scenario: All pets in active squad downed → graceful encounter end [studio] [required]

```gherkin

## Feature 8: Stacked Pet Pool Model

**System:** `StackPoolService` (new) | **Persistence:** `ready_count`, `last_update` fields on stacked pet records
**Description:** Stacked common pets use a token bucket model. The stack has a `ready_count` that depletes when downed and refills over time.

### Background

```gherkin
Given a stacked pet record has fields: { pet_id, total_count, ready_count, last_update }
And the base recharge_per_instance_seconds = 300 (for mid-tier content)
```

### Scenario: New stack defaults to fully ready [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player hatches a stack of 5 frost_drakes
When the stack is created
Then ready_count should equal 5
And total_count should equal 5
And last_update should be nil or current timestamp
```

### Scenario: Stack ready_count refreshes lazily on read [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 24, last_update: 1500 seconds ago }
And recharge_per_instance = 300 seconds
When the system queries the stack's ready_count
Then ready_count should be refreshed to min(30, 24 + floor(1500/300)) = min(30, 24 + 5) = 29
And last_update should be updated to current time
```

### Scenario: Stack ready_count caps at total_count [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 10, ready: 9, last_update: 10000 seconds ago }
And recharge_per_instance = 300
When the system queries the stack
Then ready_count should be capped at 10 (not 9 + 33 = 42)
```

### Scenario: Downing a pet from stack decrements ready_count [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 30, last_update: nil }
When a pet from the stack is downed in combat
Then ready_count should equal 29
And last_update should be set to current timestamp
```

### Scenario: Downing from already-empty stack is no-op [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 0, last_update: 100 seconds ago }
When a pet from the stack would be downed
Then ready_count should remain 0
And the stack should not "go negative"
```

### Scenario: Stack contribution scales by ready/total ratio (linear curve) [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 24 } with base_power = 100
And the configured contribution_curve = "linear"
When the system calculates stack contribution
Then the result should equal 100 × (24/30) = 80
```

### Scenario: Stack contribution uses sqrt diminishing curve when configured [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 24 } with base_power = 100
And the configured contribution_curve = "sqrt_diminishing"
When the system calculates stack contribution
Then the result should equal 100 × (sqrt(24) / sqrt(30)) ≈ 100 × 0.894 = ~89.4
```

### Scenario: Adding pets to stack increases both total and ready [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 10, ready: 5, last_update: 100 seconds ago }
When the player hatches 3 more of the same pet type with the same element
Then total_count should become 13
And ready_count should become 8 (5 + 3 new ready pets)
And last_update should remain unchanged (the refill state is unaffected)
```

### Scenario: Removing pets from stack pulls from ready first [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 25 }
When the player trades away 10 of this pet
Then ready_count should become 15 (25 - 10, pulled from ready)
And total_count should become 20
```

### Scenario: Removing more than ready falls through to non-ready [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 5 }
When the player trades away 10 of this pet
Then ready_count should become 0
And total_count should become 20
And the system should still allow the trade (deletes are not blocked by spirit form)
```

### Scenario: Cooldown of 0 means stack refills instantly [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { total: 30, ready: 20 } in a configured 0-cooldown zone
When the system queries ready_count
Then ready_count should become 30 immediately
```

```

### Scenario: Stacked pets occupy one active squad slot [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a stack { pet_id: "frost_drake", total: 30 }
When the player deploys the stack to active squad
Then the stack occupies 1 slot in active_squad
And the remaining 4 slots are available for other deployments
But the stack's full 30 pets contribute to combat per the pool model
```

### Scenario: Active squad persists across sessions [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player with specific pets in active_squad
When the player logs out and back in
Then profile.active_squad should be restored exactly
But all swap cooldowns should be reset (fresh session)

And injury_rule = "best_available"
When the roster is invoked
Then active squad should contain [pet_A, pet_C, pet_B] in that order (most-recovered first among injured)
```

### Scenario: injury_rule "deploy_anyway" uses original order regardless [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a roster with [pet_A, pet_B (spirit), pet_C (spirit)] and max_to_deploy = 3

But they are deployed anyway
```

### Scenario: A pet can appear in multiple rosters [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the player creates "Healer Team" containing pet_A
When the player also creates "Hell Squad" containing pet_A

```gherkin
Given active squad currently contains [pet_X, pet_Y]
And the player invokes a roster containing [pet_A, pet_B, pet_C]
When the roster invocation completes
Then active squad should be [pet_A, pet_B, pet_C] (replacement, not addition)
And pet_X and pet_Y are returned to bench
```

### Scenario: Deleting a pet referenced in roster removes the reference [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a roster containing pet_A
When the player permanently deletes pet_A
Then the roster's ordered_pets should no longer contain pet_A
And the roster otherwise remains intact
```

### Scenario: Trading away a pet referenced in roster removes the reference [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a roster containing pet_A
When the player trades pet_A to another player
Then the roster's ordered_pets should no longer contain pet_A
```

### Scenario: Roster max_to_deploy cannot exceed active squad capacity [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given active squad capacity is 5
When a player attempts to create a roster with max_to_deploy = 10
Then the system should clamp max_to_deploy to 5
Or reject the creation with a validation error
```

### Scenario: Roster persists across sessions [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player with 3 named rosters
When the player logs out and back in
Then all rosters should be exactly restored

```

### Scenario: Bulk delete cannot bypass per-pet confirmation for unique pets [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player selects multiple unique pets for deletion
When the player initiates the bulk action

## Feature 25: Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Scenario: Server validates all state-changing actions [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given any state-changing client request (currency spend, pet swap, power cast, portal use, trade, fusion)
When the server receives the request
Then the server should re-validate all preconditions
And reject requests with mismatched state
And log mismatches for security review
```

### Scenario: Player profile load failure has graceful fallback [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player joins with a corrupted or missing profile
When the system attempts to load the profile
Then a default profile should be created
And the player should not be locked out of the game
And the error should be logged for investigation
```

### Scenario: Layer travel rejected on missing or invalid layer ID [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a portal request with target_layer = "fake_layer"
When the system processes the request
Then it should reject with "Invalid layer"
And not perform any teleport
And not deduct any tokens
```

### Scenario: Profile schema migrations handle missing new fields [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given an existing player profile from before the alignment system was added
When the player joins after deploy
Then any missing fields (soul, archetype, light_tokens, etc.) should be initialized to safe defaults
And the player can play normally
```

### Scenario: Concurrent modifications to active squad are serialized [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given two rapid client requests to modify active_squad (e.g., hotbar mash)
When the server processes them
Then they should be serialized (executed one at a time)
And the final state should be consistent with both ops applied in order
And no race-condition state corruption should occur
```

### Scenario: Pet count cap is enforced [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player at the configured inventory cap (e.g., 1000 pets)
When the player attempts to hatch another pet
Then the hatch should be rejected with "Inventory full"
And the player should be prompted to delete or trade pets
```

### Scenario: Pet records cannot be modified by client [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given a client sends a RemoteEvent with manipulated pet fields
When the server receives the event
Then it should reject any direct pet field modifications
And only allow modifications through authorized service endpoints
```

---

## Feature 26: Template vs Prototype Configurability

### Scenario: Game-specific values are config-driven [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the prototype config defines four archetypes
When the developer creates a new game on RBX-Template
And replaces configs/archetypes.lua with a different set
Then no service code change should be required
And the new archetype set should fully function
```

### Scenario: Element multiplier matrix is config-driven [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the prototype config defines a 3-element matrix (light/shadow/chaotic)
When a different game on the template defines a 5-element matrix
Then the same modifier provider code should support both
And the matrix size is read from config at runtime
```

### Scenario: Layer count and depth are configurable [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the prototype defines 3 layers per realm (Heaven 1/2/3)
When a different game configures 9 layers per realm (Dante-style)
Then the layer system should handle 9 without code changes
And all layer-traversal logic should generalize
```

### Scenario: Pet config additions don't require code changes [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the prototype has N pet entries in configs/pets.lua
When a developer adds a new pet entry with valid fields
Then the new pet should appear in hatch pools, drop tables, and modifier calculations
And no service code modification should be required
```

### Scenario: New configs introduced by this design respect the pattern [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given the new configs: configs/elements.lua, configs/theme_utility.lua, configs/archetypes.lua, configs/powers.lua, configs/augmentation.lua, configs/enemies.lua, configs/cooldowns.lua, configs/combat.lua, configs/rosters.lua, configs/portals.lua
When the developer modifies any of these configs (within valid schemas)
Then game behavior changes accordingly
And no service code modification is required
```

```gherkin
Given a 4-player party in active Hell combat
And each player has 5 pets in active squad (20 pets total)
And enemies spawn at configured density (5-10 mobs)
When combat is active for 30+ seconds
Then frame rate should remain above 30 FPS on baseline test hardware
And no significant memory leaks should occur
```

### Scenario: Stacked pets render as single entity [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given an active squad slot containing a stack of 30 frost_drakes
When the active squad is rendered
Then a single visual entity (aura/spectral form) should appear
And not 30 individual pet meshes
```

### Scenario: Streaming radius prevents over-streaming [studio] [required]

```gherkin
Given a player in Heaven 1 at Y=+2000
And configured StreamingTargetRadius = 512 studs
When the player is rendered
Then geometry outside the streaming radius should not be loaded
And geometry in other layers (base, Hell, Heaven 2) should not be loaded
```

### Scenario: Modifier pipeline computes quickly even with many providers [unit] [required]

```gherkin
Given a pet power calculation involving 10+ stacked modifier providers
When the calculation runs
Then it should complete in under 1ms (target)
And caching/memoization should be applied where modifier inputs are stable
```

### Scenario: Save profile writes are batched [integration] [required]

```gherkin
Given multiple state changes within a short window (e.g., 1 second)
When ProfileStore writes occur
Then writes should be batched (not one write per change)
And the batched write should respect ProfileStore rate limits

## Appendix C: Open Questions & Deferred Decisions

The following scenarios are tagged [open] or [deferred] in the spec. These need decisions before implementation:

| Scenario | Question |
|---|---|
| Feature 12 — "Focus regen pauses while at zero" | Should Focus pause briefly at 0 (stun effect) or always regenerate? |
| Feature 13 — Archetype change | Should archetype change be its own ritual, or part of general respec? |
| Feature 20 — Fusion can use stacked pets | Should fusion accept stacked-pet inputs, or only unique pets? |
| Feature 21 — Chaos Rifts | Full design deferred to later phase; current scenarios are sketches. |

Resolve these before reaching the phase they're in. Document decisions in `docs/wiki/DECISIONS.md`.
