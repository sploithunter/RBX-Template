    Buff stacking config — Halo & Horns.

    The ONE rule (docs/PET_REALM_ICONS_AND_POWERS.md Part E): every % buff is an ADDITIVE fraction
    on a base of 1.0, summed per axis, then clamped to that axis's cap. Multiplicative compounding
    is banned EXCEPT a small set of global (whole-account) multipliers. BuffStack.lua implements it.

      multiplier(axis) = clamp(1 + Σ live fractions, 1, 1 + cap)
      final            = base × multiplier(axis) × Π(globals)

    Caps are FRACTION ceilings: cap = 3.0 means +300% max (×4.0). Concurrency (pick-10 + hotbar +
    cooldowns) is the first guard; these caps are the hard backstop. Every number is a dev knob.
