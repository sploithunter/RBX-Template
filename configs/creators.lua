    Creators — the registry of TOP-TIER creators (Jason + invited collaborators) and
    the Meet-The-Creator mechanic.

    Each registered creator has their OWN creator-pet species. The species is theirs
    exclusively as the APEX (creator-class grants only ever go to the creator
    themselves — colorado is Jason's, period). Other players obtain the SPECIES
    (never the apex class) through Meet-The-Creator:

        The FIRST time you are in the same server as a registered creator — and only
        that once, ever — you receive their creator EGG in your eggs inventory. The
        egg hatches a creator-species pet at the configured variant odds.

    Persisted per player in data.MetCreators[creatorUserId] = os.time().
