    game_events — the EVENT -> REACTIONS registry (config-as-code).

    Code fires a named gameplay event (GameEvents.fire("level_up", ctx)); THIS config decides what
    reacts. Each reaction kind is a key the client dispatcher (src/Client/Systems/GameEvents.lua)
    knows how to apply:

        sound = "<key in configs/sounds.lua>"   -- play that sound on its configured bus
        --   (or { key = "...", volume = 0.5 } to scale loudness for THIS event only)
        banner = { seconds, color }             -- lingering screen-center card (text = ctx.name)
        -- RULE (Jason): if another player can SEE it, they should HEAR it — world
        -- moments (level-ups, meets, the future epic level-up animation) use
        -- world_sound + world-visible visuals together; UI-only moments (achievement
        -- toasts) stay personal `sound`.
        -- RULE (Jason): never a sound without a visual — every row with `sound` must
        -- also have vfx/float/banner (CI-enforced; world_visual=true marks diegetic
        -- exceptions like pet_down where the world itself is the visual)
        -- (planned) vfx = "<CombatFX/effect spec>", toast = "<text>", ...

    Add or extend a row to react to an event WITHOUT touching the firing code; remove a row to
    silence it. The only inherently-code part is detecting the event and calling fire().

    Event sources:
      level_up   — the player's claimed level increased        (client: LevelUpController)
    Planned (wire the source, then add a row here): death, hit, area_change, egg_hatch, purchase.
