    Pet Power pipeline (Pet Realm) — config-as-code knobs for how a pet's dev-set base power
    becomes the TWO numbers shown on the inventory card (⛏ Mining / ⚔ Combat) and the live damage
    it deals. Resolved by the pure src/Shared/Game/PetPower.lua; assembled from configs by the
    shared PetPowerView so the inventory display and the dealt damage use the SAME math.

    Layers (each a multiplicative knob — add a term to add a future multiplier):
      base            — the dev knob (pets.lua base_power / huge_base_power; the pet's Power value)
      × base_scale    — global tuning lever (1 = base power maps 1:1 to pre-multiplier damage)
      × element_mult  — INTRINSIC element flat attack (configs/combat_fx.lua origin.element_stats)
      × variant_mult  — INTRINSIC golden/rainbow power bump (below)
      × aptitude      — INTRINSIC role/pet mining-vs-combat skill (pet_roles.lua mining_mult /
                        combat_mult, overridable per pet in pets.lua) -> this split is what makes a
                        pet better at MINING vs COMBAT (and drives trading)
      × context       — CONTEXTUAL: player level, boosts, gamepasses... (all default 1; built later)

    INTRINSIC layers (everything except context) = the "base calculated power" shown on the card:
    deterministic per pet, identical for everyone, so it's the fair trade-comparison number.
    CONTEXTUAL layers = the live "effective" power for a specific owner at a specific moment.
