    Zone Tracker configuration (Pet Realm location awareness).

    A server service (ZoneTrackerService) resolves which authored "area" each player is
    standing in by testing their position against the area bounding boxes already defined in
    configs/areas.lua (synthetic.center / synthetic.size). The result is written to a single
    SSOT player attribute (`CurrentArea`), which farming (AutoTargetService), area music, and
    future zone activation all read. No map touch-parts required — robust to falls/teleports.

    Detection is FOOTPRINT-based (X/Z): area boxes in areas.lua are thin floor slabs
    (size.y ~= 4), but a standing player's HRP sits several studs above the floor, so a strict
    Y test would never match. We match the X/Z footprint and apply a generous vertical band so
    a player anywhere in the play volume above an area counts as "in" it. (When stacked
    heaven/hell layers arrive at very different Y, tighten vertical_band per-layer.)
