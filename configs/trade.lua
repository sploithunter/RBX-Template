    Trade — Halo & Horns [PROTOTYPE] (Feature 19).

    Pets are tradeable (unless locked); currencies are NOT; cosmetics are. Trades
    are server-authoritative, require both players to confirm, execute atomically
    (anti-duplication), and are written to a trade-history audit log. Pure rules:
    `src/Shared/Game/TradeLogic.lua`.
