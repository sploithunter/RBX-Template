    Pet Configuration System
    
    Organizes pets by animal type with multiple variants (Basic, Golden, Rainbow)
    Includes power levels, rarities, and game mechanics for a complete pet system.
    
    Structure:
    - pets[animal_type][variant] = { stats, asset_id, etc. }
    - Easy to expand with new animals and variants
    - Balanced progression system with clear rarity tiers
