    Biome ring topology — Halo & Horns [PROTOTYPE] content.

    The map is a ring of biomes with deterministic adjacency. This config owns the
    clockwise order, each biome's theme, its dichotomy (mirror-opposite) partner,
    and its themed reward currency. The generic ring/adjacency logic lives in
    `src/Shared/Game/RingTopology.lua` and reads this table — it must never
    hardcode biome names (Feature 1: "theme is config-driven, not inferred";
    "adding a biome requires no service code changes").

    Prototype ring (clockwise): earth → ice → lava → desert → beach → (wrap).
    Dichotomies: earth↔desert, ice↔lava. beach has none.
