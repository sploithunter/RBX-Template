--[[
    Level track — what each level-up GRANTS (Halo & Horns, City-of-Heroes style).

    Total XP -> earnedLevel (LevelCurve). The player CLAIMS one level at a time; each claim
    runs this track for the new level. Pure lookup lives in src/Shared/Game/LevelTrack.lua;
    PlayerProgressionService:ClaimLevel applies it (S2). Every number here is a dev knob.

    A level can carry several rewards at once (flags are independent), but `kind` picks the
    headline the UI leads with: "power" > "milestone" > "slot" > "reward".

    IMPORTANT (sync): `power_levels` MUST match configs/powers.lua `selection_levels` and
    `slot_levels` MUST match configs/augmentation.lua `slot_grant_levels` — those configs gate
    the actual PowerService/Augmentation eligibility; this track only decides the level-up
    presentation + the bundled rewards. Together they cover EVERY level 2–50 (15 power picks +
    34 slot grants), so every claim hands you a real choice.
