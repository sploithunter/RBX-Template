    Active squad hierarchy — Halo & Horns [PROTOTYPE] (Feature 9).

    Three tiers: Inventory (all owned) -> Equipped (followers) -> Active Squad
    (fighters). Swapping the active squad mid-combat has a cooldown; out of combat
    it is instant. Read by `src/Shared/Game/ActiveSquad.lua`.

    --       pet before it fell (rewards attention; still capped so recall isn't spam).
