    configs/boot.lua — the boot dependency graph + loading-screen SSOT.

    See docs/BOOT_ORCHESTRATION.md. This is the single source of truth for:
      - which boot milestones exist, who produces each, and what each depends on
        (`milestones` — the dependency graph the BootOrchestrator validates at boot),
      - which per-player attributes gate a joining player (`player_gates`),
      - what the loading screen shows and in what order (`phases`).

    Adding a milestone: declare it here with its `produced_by` + `requires`, have the
    producing service call BootReadiness.signal(name), and have every consumer
    BootReadiness.await(name). Never reintroduce :Wait()-on-fire-once / FindFirstChild-abort
    / poll loops — if you need something at boot, it is a milestone with an edge here.
