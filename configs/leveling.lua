    Leveling / difficulty scaling — Halo & Horns [PROTOTYPE].

    Combat numbers stay in a tight ~100 band; LEVEL DIFFERENCE does the scaling (see
    src/Shared/Game/LevelScale). Pets level up to out-level enemies (tougher without HP
    inflation); enemies show a difficulty colour relative to YOUR level.

    -- far too fast. min = 1 guarantees any successful action grants at least 1 XP, so small
    -- shares that floor to 0 still tick the bar (the "integer" floor — intentional). Tune

    -- carries a risk PREMIUM over farming. Empirically calibrated (Jason): active combat measured
    -- ~75-93 XP/min vs ~195 XP/min mining — backwards. xp_per_level = 2.0 → a level-21 trash kill ≈
    -- 42 XP → ~378 XP/min at ~9 kills/min ≈ 2× farming. rank_xp_mult pays lieutenants/bosses extra ON
