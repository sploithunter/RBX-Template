-- Pet enchant configuration.
--
-- This is the single source of truth for both:
-- 1. how enchants roll: rarity profiles, roll counts, weights, strength ranges;
-- 2. what enchants do: modifier stage/kind/currency/combine/amount mappings.
--
-- Saved pets should store only rolled state such as `{ id = "scholar",
-- strength = 2 }`. Do not put enchant behavior on pet configs or individual pet
-- records. To rebalance or redefine an enchant, edit `effects` below.
--
-- For an effect to be live, some gameplay system must resolve the matching
-- modifier context through ModifierService. Current live contexts include
-- `breakable_reward`, `pet_xp`, `hatch_luck`, `secret_hatch_luck`,
-- `pet_damage`, `team_power`, and `pet_efficiency`.
