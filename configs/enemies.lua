    Enemies — Halo & Horns [PROTOTYPE] (Feature 10: Combat).

    Enemy archetypes. Each enemy has:
      role       — combat role, the MIRROR of the pet roles (configs/pet_roles.lua):
                   tank | melee | ranged | support. A TAG for now (drives the enemy HUD
                   threat read + future role-motion: tanks plant, ranged kite, etc.). Movement
                   is NOT yet role-driven — that lands as a separate A/B pass so we can compare.
      hp         — base health (10x world: pools x10 both sides, damage untouched —
                   see configs/combat.lua pet_down_threshold_factor; scaled by party size at spawn)
      tier       — Spirit Form cooldown tier applied to a pet this enemy downs
                   (maps to configs/spirit_form.lua cooldown_tiers)
      attack     — { damage, cadence, sundering }
                     damage    = damage dealt to a targeted pet per hit
                     cadence   = seconds between attacks
                     sundering = Focus drained from the player per hit (0 = none)
      auto_heal  — (support) { interval, amount, range }: mends the most-hurt nearby enemy.
      model_asset— uploaded model id (cloned via AssetFetch → PlaceAssets cache). Omit and the
                   service builds a procedural block (placeholder until the art is imported).
      drop_table — currency/token amounts on defeat (numeric = deterministic; *_chance = random).

    EARTH enemy faction (the starter biome's wild creatures, the dark mirror of your Earth pets):
      tank=bear · melee=rabid_dog · ranged=murder_crow + vicious_cat · support=rabid_bunny.
    Read by CombatService via ConfigLoader; pure math lives in `src/Shared/Game/CombatMath.lua`.
