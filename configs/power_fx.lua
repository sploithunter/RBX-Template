    Power FX registry — see docs/PET_REALM_POWER_DATA_MODEL.md §7.1.

    FIRST-VISUAL-TEST scaffold. Named effect primitives mapped onto the EXISTING CombatFX facade
    (`CombatFX.play(spec, ctx)`), so the admin FX-probe plays real effects you can eyeball — no new
    renderer to validate blind. Each primitive picks a CombatFX `pattern`; `color`/`light` default to
    "origin" (the element drives them — CombatFX already resolves per-element colour); `sound` is nil
    until audio is authored (drop SoundIds in later, same placeholder→override pattern as art).

    `probe` drives the admin FX-probe sequence: it steps each listed primitive across every element
    so one click shows the full matrix (Casting on the player, Impact on a dummy).

    Patterns available today (from CombatFX): "pbaoe" (burst around the caster), "st_aoe" (strike at
    a point), "st_attack" (ranged bolt → target), "attached" (a following aura/bubble). Expand the
    primitive list + add bespoke `asset`/`sound` per primitive as real art lands.
