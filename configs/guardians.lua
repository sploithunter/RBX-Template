    Summon-guardian config (#178) — the capstone "call a pet" powers.

    Gaia's Colossus (geomancer) and the Genie of the Dunes (sandwalker) summon a temporary GUARDIAN
    that stands with your squad for `duration`s, then despawns. To keep it firewall-safe (§16.5) the
    guardian doesn't deal player damage directly — it expresses its fantasy through squad buffs while
    it's on the field:
      • Colossus = a WALL + a FIST: big squad +Defense and x pet-damage while it stands (tank identity).
      • Djinn    = a FOUNT: revives every downed pet on arrival, full-heals, then a heal-over-time tick.

    Model: Jason is making real guardian models — drop their asset ids in `model_asset`. Until then the
    service clones a scaled-up squad pet as a placeholder (so the power is fully functional now).
