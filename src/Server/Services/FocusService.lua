    FocusService — Feature 12 (Player Character / Spirit Presence).

    The player is an ethereal, INVULNERABLE supporter — there is NO health stat. The only player
    resource is Focus, spent on support powers and disrupted by enemy "Sundering" attacks; it
    regenerates over time.

    Focus is RUNTIME-ONLY — held in memory (self._focus), NEVER persisted (Jason). It refills to
    focus_max in focus_max / regen_per_second seconds (~20s), far less than any logout→login gap, so
    a returning player is always effectively full no matter what we'd have saved — persisting it is
    pure wasted datastore writes. So: lazy-init to focus_max, regen in memory, mirror to the HUD via
    the Focus / FocusMax player attributes. No saves anywhere.

    The Focus economy lives here. PowerService:Cast CHARGES a power's focus_cost via FocusService:Cast
    at the commit point (an empty pool refuses the cast with not_enough_focus); cooldown lives with
    the Power system. The pure FocusMath core does the arithmetic.
