    MountainTime — pure UTC -> America/Denver (Mountain) conversion with US DST.

    Roblox servers run in UTC (os.date("!*t")). Pet Realm's recurring events are scheduled
    in MOUNTAIN time ("ColoradoPlays" — Money Monday at midnight Mountain, not UTC), so any
    weekday/hour decision must convert first.

    US Mountain DST (since 2007):
      • MDT (UTC-6) from 02:00 on the 2nd Sunday of March
      • MST (UTC-7) from 02:00 on the 1st Sunday of November
    DST membership is decided from the calendar date (the 1-hour transition window doesn't
    matter for day-long events), so this stays a pure function of a UTC time — no reliance on
    os.time() / the host machine's timezone, which keeps the headless spec deterministic.

    wday convention matches os.date: 1 = Sunday .. 7 = Saturday.
