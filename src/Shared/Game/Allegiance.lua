    Allegiance (pure) — the heaven/hell combat-targeting asymmetry.

    The realm farming-vs-combat mechanic (Jason):
      • HELL attackers attack ALL targets (free-for-all → hell is combat).
      • HEAVEN attackers attack ONLY hell targets (→ heaven coexists → farming).
      • NEUTRAL actors have "free will" and take the CURRENT REALM's side, then follow
        the rule above (a neutral pet in heaven acts heaven; in hell acts hell).
      • Off-realm (the neutral homeworld) the mechanic doesn't apply — everyone attacks
        all, exactly as combat worked before realms.

    Pure: no Roblox API. Sides are plain strings; the service resolves a pet's side from
    its species `realm` and the current realm from the player's layer, then calls hostile().
