    PowerSelection — pure functional core for level-up power selection (Feature 14).

    No Roblox APIs. The service supplies the player's level, selected list, and the
    archetype's available power pool (computed via ArchetypeLogic). Selections are
    one-per-selection-level and accumulate; a power must be in the archetype pool
    and not already selected.

      selectionsReached(level, selectionLevels)                 -> integer
      pendingSelections(level, selectedCount, selectionLevels)  -> integer (>= 0)
      isSelected(powerId, selectedList)                         -> boolean
      canSelect(powerId, availablePowers, selectedList, level, selectionLevels)
                                                                -> { ok, reason? }
      menuRows(pool, powers, level, ownedSet)                   -> { {id, unlockLevel, state}, ... }

-- Resolve a powerset POOL (a list of power ids — e.g. configs/archetypes.lua `generic_pool`) into
-- menu rows ORDERED BY unlock_level ascending, then id alphabetically (a stable tiebreak). The pool
-- array only defines MEMBERSHIP; ordering + gating both come from each power's `unlock_level` in
-- `powers`, so a balance pass (re-gate, which re-orders) is a CONFIG edit only — never code.
-- `ownedSet` = { [powerId] = true } for already-picked powers.
--   state: "owned" (picked) | "available" (unlocked: unlock_level <= level) | "locked" (future level)
-- The level you can actually CHOOSE a power: the first selection level >= its unlock_level.
-- Falls back to the unlock level when no schedule is given (or none qualifies), so callers
-- without a schedule behave exactly as before.
