    Snapshot tests for the sleitnick/Net RemoteEvents used by MonetizationService after migration.

    We only assert that the expected RemoteEvents are created and of the correct class.
    Behavioural tests are handled in MonetizationService.spec; this file guarantees the
    networking surface.
