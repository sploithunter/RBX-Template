ðŸŒŸ UNIVERSAL CONSISTENCY SYSTEM ðŸŒŸ
=========================================

ðŸŽ¯ THE POWER OF ONE IMAGE RULES ALL!

With the new global defaults system, you can achieve 90% visual consistency across your entire game 
with minimal configuration. Here's how it works:

ðŸ“‹ GLOBAL PANEL SYSTEM:
======================
â€¢ Blue Panel (6208057940) = ALL panel backgrounds automatically
â€¢ Teal Header (16809347055) = ALL panel headers automatically  
â€¢ Gear icons, titles, layouts = consistent across ALL panels

ðŸ”˜ GLOBAL BUTTON SYSTEM:
========================
â€¢ Teal Background (16809347055) = ALL button backgrounds automatically
â€¢ Icon sizing, text styling, positioning = consistent across ALL buttons
â€¢ Notification badges = consistent styling and positioning

ðŸ’¡ CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES:
==========================

MINIMAL BUTTON (4 lines = professional styling):
```lua
{type = "menu_button", config = {
    name = "Quest", 
    icon = "ðŸŽ¯", 
    text = "Quest", 
    action = "quest_claim_action"
    -- ðŸŽ¨ Automatically gets: teal background, perfect sizing, professional layout!
}}
```

MINIMAL PANEL (uses 100% global defaults):
```lua
local panelResult = baseUI:CreateImagePanel("inventory_panel", {}, parent)
-- ðŸŽ¨ Automatically gets: blue background, teal header, consistent styling!
```

SELECTIVE OVERRIDE (special shop with custom background):
```lua
{type = "menu_button", config = {
    name = "Shop", 
    background_image = "18852000893",      -- ðŸŽ¨ OVERRIDE: Special shop background 
    icon = "6031075938", 
    text = "Shop", 
    action = "shop_action"
    -- ðŸŽ¨ Everything else inherits from global defaults!
}}
```

ðŸš€ BENEFITS:
============
âœ… Visual Consistency: 90% of UI looks professional automatically
âœ… Minimal Configuration: Most elements need 3-4 lines of config
âœ… Easy Maintenance: Change one global default = update entire game
âœ… Import Ready: Perfect for importing professional GUIs from other games
âœ… Override Flexibility: Can still customize when needed

ðŸŽ¨ ASSET USAGE:
